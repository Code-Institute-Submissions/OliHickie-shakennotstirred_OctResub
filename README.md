Shaken, Not Stirred! is a website designed for users to share, discover, rate and review cocktail recipes. The website allows a user to create their own profile with which they may upload, edit and delete cocktail recipes. A user can view other user's cocktails and add a written review as well as rate the recipe. This website was created as part of my Full Stack Web Developer Diploma with Code Institute.

## Design

The overall design was aimed at being sophisticated with a touch of fun. I wanted the site to appeal to both sexes and people of all ages. 

- Color Scheme

    The color scheme was chosen to be fairly simple as, inevitably, the use of imagery would brighten up the site. Therefore, I concentrated on three colors for the content of the pages; black, white and gold. Black and White were chosen to give a 'Black Tie' feel and that, along with splashes of gold, would give the site a clean and sophisticated look. I chose slightly off-black and off-white to soften the page and contrast.

- Typography

    The two main fonts used on the site are 'Yeseva One' and 'Roboto', both of which were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

    'Yeseva One' is reserved for larger headings (h1 - h3) and is a large, heavy font with soft edges. I wanted headings to be clear but not too strong. 'Roboto' is a clear font as is used for the website content. It is easy to read but is softened by its cursive style. I find that both fonts fit the theme of being sophisticated by generally light-hearted.

    Occassionally, a more calligraphic style font is used in some of the feature content. This is to add a welcoming feel to the home page and the logo. The fonts are not as easy to read as the main fonts, however, the added style adds a warmth and a conversational feel to the (often) subtitles in contrast to 'Yeseva One'.
