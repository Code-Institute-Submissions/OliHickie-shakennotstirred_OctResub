Shaken, Not Stirred! is a website designed for users to share, discover, rate and review cocktail recipes. The website allows a user to create their own profile with which they may upload, edit and delete cocktail recipes. A user can view other user's cocktails and add a written review as well as rate the recipe. This website was created as part of my Full Stack Web Developer Diploma with Code Institute.

## Design

The overall design was aimed at being sophisticated with a touch of fun. I wanted the site to appeal to both sexes and people of all ages. 

- Color Scheme

    The color scheme was chosen to be fairly simple as, inevitably, the use of imagery would brighten up the site. Therefore, I concentrated on three colors for the content of the pages; black, white and gold. Black and White were chosen to give a 'Black Tie' feel and that, along with splashes of gold, would give the site a clean and sophisticated look. I chose slightly off-black and off-white to soften the page and contrast. 

    ![Image of Colors Used - White, Gold and Black](static/images/readme/color-p.jpg)

- Typography

    The two main fonts used on the site are 'Yeseva One' and 'Roboto', both of which were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

    'Yeseva One' is reserved for larger headings (h1 - h3) and is a large, heavy font with soft edges. I wanted headings to be clear but not too strong. 'Roboto' is a clear font as is used for the website content. It is easy to read but is softened by its cursive style. I find that both fonts fit the theme of being sophisticated by generally light-hearted. 

    ![Image of Yeseva One font in use](static/images/readme/yesevaone.png)
    ![Image of Roboto font in use](static/images/readme/roboto.png)

    Occassionally, a more calligraphic style font is used in some of the feature content. This is to add a welcoming feel to the home page and the logo. The fonts are not as easy to read as the main fonts, however, the added style adds a warmth and a conversational feel to the (often) subtitles in contrast to 'Yeseva One'.

- Imagery

    Imagery is widely used on this site. The colors break up the black and white template and add a friendly and inviting feel. 
    The homepage is littered with imagery to welcome the user and help a new user understand the function of the site. There is little control over what imagery is uploaded by the user when adding a cocktail recipe. However, to ensure the image is visible, the height has been fixed and, if any inappropriate imagery is added, the admin (or site owner) is able to edit and change the image. Imagery is an important way of enticing the user into clicking a recipe. With that in mind, if no image url is added to a recipe, a default image loads instead. 

- Wireframes

    Below are my wireframes for the site, showing examples of the pages across three screen sizes. 

# Features
- **Header**
    
    The header is available on all pages and houses a website logo (which links the user to the home page) and navigation item. On smaller screens, the navigation items are located in a collapsible menu which is accessed using a hamburger icon in the top left of the screen. 

- **Nav bar items**

    The nav bar items are listed as follows:

     ![Image of a calligraphhic font in use](static/images/readme/navbar.png)

     'My Recipes' is only visible and available to users once logged in. 'Log In' replaces 'Log Out' if no user is currently logged in and both items take the user to the log in page.

- **Footer**

    The footer appears on all pages and comprises of three main componants. 
    
    1. A repitition of the logo along with a description of the purpose of the site. 
    2. A quick search feature which, when a spirit is chosen, will take the user directly to the cocktails page and display a list of cocktails containing that base spirit.
    3. A feedback link to email the site owner in case a user has any feedback or would like to report an issue. 


- **Home Page**

    The home page is a welcoming page designed to give the user an outlook of the whole site as well as offer some suggestions for cocktails. As a site owner, it is also designed to encourage a new user to sign up for an account. 

    The top banner consists of a carousel with three slides; the first (upon the page loading) is a slide directing the user to log in or create an account. Two further slides are suggesting favourite cocktail recipes to try. All three slides are clickable a link the user to the desired page (whether the login page or recipe page).

    Below the carousel is a wide clickable button taking the user to all the recipes available. The button also contains a counter displaying how many cocktails are currently on the database. 

    The next section is a random cocktail picker that, on each page load, will return a random recipe from the database and display it to the user. 

    Below that is a 'Cocktail for Every Season' section, again, designed to inspire and entice a user into clicking onto a cocktail recipe and trying it out. 

    N.B. all cocktails that appear on to home page as page
